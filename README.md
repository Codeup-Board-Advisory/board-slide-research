## About the Project

A stakeholder has provided a list of questions to be answered before a board meeting. There is some ambiguity in the questions. Make and explain appropriate assumptions to answer these questions focusing on content delivery to students and any issues that may impact the bottom line of the organization.

## Project Goals

Acquire and explore website access data in order to answer questions about content access and delivery. 

**DELIVERABLES:**
[] Email answering questions in clear language.
- Include link to notebook.
- Attach slide.
[] Single slide describing most interesting or impactful finding(s).
- Executive fummary format.
[] Github final notebook showing data exploration used to answer the questions.
[] Use modules (acquire.py, prepare.py, etc.)


## Project Description

## Initial Questions

1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?

2. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts seemed to gloss over?

3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?

4. Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldnâ€™t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses?

5. At some point in 2019, the ability for students and alumni to access both curriculums (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before?

6. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?

7. Which lessons are least accessed?

8. Anything else notable in the data?
